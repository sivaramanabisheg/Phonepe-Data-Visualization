## Problem Statement
The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains extensive data on various metrics and statistics. The goal of this project is to extract, process, and visualize this data in a manner that is both insightful and accessible. The solution involves:

1. Cloning the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository to extract relevant data.
2. Transforming and cleaning the data for analysis.
3. Storing the processed data in a MySQL database.
4. Developing an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly to visualize the data.
5. Providing dynamic dropdown options for users to explore different insights.

## Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: Clone the GitHub repository and store the data in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.
2. **Data Transformation**: Use Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it is ready for analysis.
3. **Database Insertion**: Utilize the `mysql-connector-python` library to insert the processed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, featuring geo visualizations and multiple dropdown options.
5. **Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the MySQL database and dynamically update the dashboard.
6. **Deployment**: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and accessible to users.

## Results
The final product is a live geo visualization dashboard that provides insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The dashboard includes at least 10 dropdown options for users to explore various metrics, with data dynamically retrieved from a MySQL database.
